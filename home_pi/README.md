# Home Automation Simulation on Raspberry Pi
## Raspberry Pi + Python Project

In this project, using a Raspberry Pi 3, I've created a home automation simulation. Through a GUI (Graphic User Interface), developed in Tkinter's Python Library, it is possible to control the FAN's speed, dimerize some LED lights, switch on/off a light bulb and read the data of a DHT11 sensor.
I also developed some graphics, which show the temperature and and humidity. The interface also provides the possibility of send the data values to a e-mail, informed by the user.
